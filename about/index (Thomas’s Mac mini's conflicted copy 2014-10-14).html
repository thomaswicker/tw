	<h1>ABOUT PAGE</h1> 

	<p>Currently engineering Software for GLG. Formerly Managed front-end development at Time Warner Cable.</p>

	<p>Max Quattromani is a front-end developer living and working in Denver, CO. In a previous life, Max was an auto mechanic who woke up one day and realized that working from the neck down sucked. The tools were sold and a computer was purchased. The first project was a tire-sales website for a tire distribution company he was working for. It was a truly horrible website (but hey, the clock still works!). But committed to honing the craft; he pressed on. A few freelance jobs later and he had landed a full-time gig as a Jr. Web Developer with a lip balm manufacturing company.</p>

	<p>As the skillset and passion grew, the right opportunity came along in the form of a contract with Time Warner Cable - this parlayed into a managers role and building a team of some of the finest coders this side of the Mississippi.</p>

	<p>Today, working as a self-employed freelancer, Max is developing the front-ends primarily for GLG and knocking out a few side projects along the way. Have a look around the site and if you have feedback, don't be shy.</p>

	<h3>How I work</h3>
	MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) - running Yosemite beta v1.0
	Sublime Text is my editor of choice
	Chrome: I tend to develop almost exclusively in Chrome at the start of projects. At one point I developed in Firefox exclusively. These days though, I typically do mile-marker checkins in Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer (back to IE8, let's not dwell on that fact).

	<h3>About this site</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Built on Jekyll, the open source static site generator</li>
		<li>Hosted on Github Pages</li>
		<li>The HTML is written in vanilla HTML, but I'm redoing it in HAML, because HAML is the bees knees!</li>
		<li>The CSS is written in Sass</li>
		<li>Then things get grunted, but I'm starting to lean towards gulp. Time will tell.</li>
		<li>Posts are written in markdown</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This site was previously just an online resume holder, but I've decided that I have things to say and share so this seemed like the most logical place. I have also published my style guide and pattern library which are pet projects that I love to tweak and improve occassionaly; typically after I learn a new shiny thing.</p>
