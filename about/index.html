		<h2>A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h2>

		<div class="body-about-left sm-12-12 md-7-12 lg-8-12 xl-9-12">
			<blockquote>Currently contracting as a Senior Software Developer for <a href="https://www.oppenheimerfunds.com/advisors/" target="blank">Oppenheimer Funds</a> in Centennial, CO.</blockquote>

			<p>I am a front end software developer based out of Denver, CO. Jumping into the Wayback Machine... I started off in early 2000 as a fine artist and abstract painter. I quickly began pursuing a career in Graphic Design focusing on the basics of color theory, layout, typography and more. This built the foundation for what was to become my true passion, UI/UX and Front End Development. </p></br></br>

			<p>Fast forward to present day, I now have over 10 years of hands-on real world experience in UI/UX design, rapid prototyping and front-end development. I have created websites and applications for a wide range of industries ranging from apparel to health care to the financial industry. I practice user focused design principles basing all my decisions on a strategic blend of user driven need and business requirements. My focus is building responsive mobile first software backed by clean semantic code that always focuses on speed and flexibilty.</p>

			<p>In 2005 I opened a small freelance development business in Denver, XIRI Media. Through this company I entertain small and large contracts for businesses around Denver and the US. In the little spare time I have... I develop personal software/app ideas and open source projects.</p>

			<p>Aside from all the work stuff, and most importantly in my life... I am a father of two beautiful and healthy girls that keep me on my toes and my life balanced. I love spending every free moment I have with them reading, playing a game on XBOX/PS4, watching some Doctor Who, or just chilling out and drawing or painting. I have also been teaching them HTML/SASS and they are learning it at about 10x the speed I learned... ahhh... to be young again.</p>
