	<h1>ABOUT PAGE</h1> 

	<p>Currently creating software for Oppenheimer Funds in Centennial, CO. Additionally I freelance through my web development </p></br></br>

	<p>Thomas Wicker is a front end software developer based out of Denver, CO. I pride myself in staying on top of current industry trends and focus on UI/UX solutions that enhance the products I build.</p></br></br>

	<p>I am proud to define myself as a UI/UX Designer and Front End Developer focusing on creative composition, strategy and most importantly... user experience. I believe that even the most mundane of tools and processes that we interact with from day to day can be engaging and exciting to use with the right creative approach. I have a diverse background in web development and UI/UX with an underlying core of fine art and graphic design principles. I focus on clean semantic code and designing complex interfaces that engage the user.</p>
</br></br>

	<p>I have over 15 years of hands-on work experience in UI/UX design, rapid prototyping and front-end development for rich Internet applications and mobile devices. I practice user centered design principles basing design decisions on user driven needs and business goals.</p></br></br>
