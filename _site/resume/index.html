      <p class="quote">A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.</p>

						</br></br>
						Thomas possessed excellent leadership skills as a project-manager, and as a colleague he was essential in excelling the project above and beyond the initial scope. Thomas's rich background in art and design gives him an a eye for intuitive User Experience and he is a excellent Front-End Developer. I would highly recommend him for any UI/UX development project.
